## Let's help WTWY

In my endeavor to help a fictitious NGO called WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), aiming to raise money for their cause through a Spring GALA, organized annually in the month of May - I decided to figure out which locations in NYC would be most suited for their street teams to hand out pamphlets to potential attendees such that they can maximize attendance and donation.

## Let's get some data

Best place to get data about humans congregating in specific areas of NYC?
The NYC subway station company.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is nice enough to post weekly Turnstile data for all subway stations in New York City.

What's a Turnstile you ask? A Turnstile is the metal barrier you push through to enter/exit a station. Each station has multiple Turnstiles, often grouped together in groups of 2 or more.
