Hello, I am Yajas Dwivedi. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, specifically Controls, Mechatronics and Robotics. I am intrigued by the possibilities of using Statistics, Linear Algebra and other mathematical techniques to find patterns in data. This blog contains some of my work.

Have questions, comments or suggestions? Feel free to [send me an e-mail](yajasdwivedi@gmail.com).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yajasd/) and my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/YajasD).

Thanks for reading!
